# Machine Learning :

- Machine Learning is like teaching a computer to do something by itself.
- It's like if you had a magic coloring book, and the first time you colored a picture of an apple, you had to pick the colors yourself.
- But then, the next time you got to a picture of an apple, the magic coloring book remembered what colors you used the last time and filled in the apple for you.
- Thatâ€™s what machine learning does. It helps computers learn from previous experiences, so they can make decisions and do tasks on their own.

**Definition :**  Machine learning refers to the computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience by using data. The basics of machine learning (ML) algorithms are to interpret data. The machine learning algorithms are generally classified as:

- Learning style: supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised
- Function: regression, clustering, and decision tree

Whatever the case may be, ML algorithms consists of representation, evaluation, and optimization.
