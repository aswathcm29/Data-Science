# Machine Learning :

- Machine Learning is like teaching a computer to do something by itself.
- It's like if you had a magic coloring book, and the first time you colored a picture of an apple, you had to pick the colors yourself.
- But then, the next time you got to a picture of an apple, the magic coloring book remembered what colors you used the last time and filled in the apple for you.
- Thatâ€™s what machine learning does. It helps computers learn from previous experiences, so they can make decisions and do tasks on their own.
